Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Developing

```bash
# start dev with SWA (Azure Static Web App CLI) with functions
npm run dev

# start dev standalone
npm run dev:standalone

# start azure functions standalone
npm run dev:func
```

> Note: you can also use `yarn`

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```
